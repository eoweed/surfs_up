# surfs_up


### Purpose:
##### The purpose of this project is to determine if it is worth opening a year-round surf and ice cream shop on the island of Oahu. The data provided has weather information from January 2010 to August 2017, and the analysis shows a comparison of temperature statistics for the month of June and the month of December.

![December Temps](https://github.com/eoweed/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/DecemberTemps.png)

### Results:
##### Differences between June and December:
##### - There is almost a 5 degree difference in average temperature.
#####     - June: 74.944118
#####     - December: 71.041529
##### - The minimum recorded temperature in June is 64 degrees, and the minimum recorded temperature in December is 56 degrees.
##### - The maximum recorded temperature in June is 85 degrees, and the minimum recorded temperature in December is 83 degrees.


### Summary:
##### Based on the analysis, the average temperature for the months of June and December only differs by about 5 degrees, and the standard deviation by about 3 degrees for each month. It may be worth opening a year-round surf and ice cream shop if the temperature is consistent. However, the minimum temperature of 56 degrees in December might be too cold for surfing and ice cream. Another analysis should be performed to determine how often the temperature is that low. In comparison, the maximum temperatures for June and December are both above 80 degrees, so it may be worth analyzing how often the temperature is that warm. Lastly, it may also be necessary to update the weather data to include more recent information.
